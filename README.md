Well "this thing" is a repacker, the software use compression method to decrease games files size then, after the compression, you can "install" the game (basicly decompress) to a folder and run it.

#### Okay but how the compression work ? 

You can a find a clear and simple explanation of how data compression work [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression)

#### So i can compress from like 100GB to 1GB ?

LMAO no, it's depend on witch compression method you use for what files (you can find a better explanation {here]())
